\usage{
get_connection(name, execution)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the connection as defined in connections.yaml.}

\item{execution}{The execution environment containing the connections registry and active connections.}
}
\value{
Returns a database connection object (DBI connection).
}
\description{
Retrieves or creates a database connection based on the specified connection name.
}
\details{
This function manages database connections in a centralized way. It checks if a connection
with the specified name already exists in the execution environment. If it does and is still
valid, it returns the existing connection. Otherwise, it creates a new connection using the
configuration defined in the connections registry (connections.yaml).

The function supports multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redshift, Netezza, etc.)
through a pluggable system. Each backend is defined in the connections.yaml file with its
specific connection parameters.
