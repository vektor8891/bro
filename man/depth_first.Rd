\title{Depth-First Search for Dependencies}
\usage{
depth_first(i, dependencies)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{The index of the starting node for depth-first search.}

\item{dependencies}{The matrix representing dependencies (1 for dependencies, 0 for no dependency).}
}
\value{
Returns a vector containing the nodes visited in a depth-first manner starting from the specified node.
}
\description{
Performs a depth-first search to find dependencies and paths leading to a specified node in a directed graph.
}
\details{
This function takes an index 'i' and a matrix 'dependencies' as input, where 'dependencies' represents a directed graph
with nodes and dependencies. It initializes a boolean vector 'visited' to track visited nodes and an integer vector 'result'
to store the path in a depth-first manner.

The depth-first search (DFS) is performed using a helper function 'dfs'. It explores the graph, marking visited nodes,
and appends the nodes to the 'result' vector in the order of traversal. The search avoids repeating nodes in the paths.
