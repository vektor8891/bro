\title{Find Dependency Path for a Node}
\usage{
find_path(node, nodes, dependencies)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{The node for which the dependency path is to be found.}

\item{nodes}{The matrix representing nodes in the graph.}

\item{dependencies}{The matrix representing dependencies (1 for dependencies, 0 for no dependency).}
}
\value{
Returns a vector containing the names of nodes in the dependency path for the specified node.
}
\description{
Finds the dependency path for a specified node in a graph, considering both direct and indirect dependencies.
}
\details{
This function takes a 'node' object, a matrix 'nodes' representing the nodes in the graph, and a matrix 'dependencies'
representing the dependencies (1 for dependencies, 0 for no dependency). It first identifies the index of the starting
node in the dependencies matrix. Then, it uses the depth-first search function to find the indices of nodes in the
dependency path.

The resulting path is converted to node names using the row names of the dependencies matrix and returned.
